# Case Study #1

Fix all tests related to Organization for Patient Base Migration

---

# The Challenge

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-8">
<div>

## The Problem
- Organization violations was not track in test files
- Hundreds of tests to refactor
- Complex test dependencies
- Time-sensitive project

</div>
</div>

---

# What Happened Concretely

<div class="space-y-6">

## Step-by-Step Process

- **Plan**: AI analyzed 200+ test files, identified common patterns and define resolution patterns
- **Fix in Batch**: Start 10 agents to fix all tests
- **Run all tests to check**: Detect complex cases
- **Alignement**: Manual review and edge case handling
- **Trade-off**: Some tests was too complex to be fixed and are removed from the PR


<v-clicks>

## Result üí°

<div class="mt-2 p-4 bg-blue-500/10 rounded">
More than half tests refactored with AI assistance letting all teams focusing on the complex cases
</div>

</v-clicks>

</div>

# Key Takeaways

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-8">
<div>

## What Worked ‚úÖ

- AI is great to apply refactoring patterns at scale
- **Batch processing** allow a quick fix
- Combining AI speed with **human review** to ensure acceptation

</div>
<div>

## What Didn't Work ‚ùå

- AI struggled with **edge cases** and complex business logic
- Factories with **non-standard** implementation like Agenda
- Some tests needed **100% manual** refactoring

</div>
</div>

## Lessons Learned üí°

<div class="mt-2 p-4 bg-blue-500/10 rounded">
AI is a powerful accelerator, but not a replacement for understanding your codebase

# Case Study #2

Finding Owners for 54 Feature Switches

# The Challenge

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-8">
<div>

## The Problem
- 54 feature switches affected **by default** to our team
- Reassigned to our team "by mistake"
- No documentation
- Unknown business impact

</div>
<div v-click>

## AI-Assisted Methodology

1. **Create a plan**: Ask AI to generate a file with each FS, owner and a rational with a placeholder... Commit !
2. **Code archaeology**: started 10 agents with a mission to use MCPs to investigate
3. **Ownership assignation**: Fill the file with suggested owner, level of certitude and a rational with a link
4. **Ping all teams**: Start negociation

</div>
</div>

# PR creation

<div class="space-y-4">

## MCPs for the win

<v-clicks>

- **AI scanned github && git history** for each switch: original PRs, authors, related changes
- **Confluence and JIRA**: who created FS and where are they used
- **DUST**: gather a vision from another LLM

</v-clicks>

<div v-click class="mt-6 grid grid-cols-3 gap-4">

<div class="p-4 bg-green-500/10 rounded">

**50 FS**
reaffected

</div>

<div class="p-4 bg-yellow-500/10 rounded">

**4 FS**
deleted

</div>

<div class="p-4 bg-blue-500/10 rounded">

**0 FS**
for our team üéâ

# Ownership assignment

# Key Takeaways

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-8">
<div>

## What Worked ‚úÖ

- Commit a plan at first and ask AI to update it faciliate parallelization
- Ai detected unused FS and suggeted to delete them
- 1 PR helps to gather aggreement between teams
- Having a suggested ownership and a rational forced teams to suggest a better owner

</div>
<div>

## What Didn't Work ‚ùå

- More than half suggestions was invalid üôÉ
- **Hallucination** on one team name and suggested deleted Doctoteams

</div>
</div>
